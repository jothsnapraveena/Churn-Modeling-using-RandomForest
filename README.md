The client PowerCo - a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to small and medium sized enterprises.
The energy market has had a lot of change in recent years and there are more options than ever for customers to choose from.
PowerCo are concerned about their customers leaving for better offers from other energy providers. When a customer leaves to use another service provider, this is called churn.
This is becoming a big issue for PowerCo and this project is  to help diagnose the reason why their customers are churning.

The client believes that one potential reason for this churnT, one being how “sensitive” the price is. In other words, how much is price a factor in a customer’s choice to stay with or leave PowerCo?
So we need to test the hypotheis whether price sensitivity is the major reason for churn.

The following framework is followed to test the hypothesis.
- We need to prepare the data and engineer features 
- Then, we can test our hypothesis using a binary classification model (e.g. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Machines to name a few)
- Here I used Random Forest 
- With the trained model, we would be able to extrapolate the extent to which price sensitivity influences churn
